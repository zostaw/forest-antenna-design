# Forest transmittion

It's just an experiment, I wanna see if I can design an antenna that will transmit signal to a forest nearby.  
The forest is in front of my window, elevated significantly (probably around 50-60 meters above my window).  
Between my balcony and the peak of the forest is around 400m and a lot of obstacles in between buildings same size as mine and trees obviously).  
But from what I've seen it seems that there should be LOS condition.  
Because of that and to reduce the number of factor that I need to focus on, I assume free space conditions for the time being.  
Once I'll design the first version of antenna, I'll start analysing it from more nuanced perspective of propagation conditions.
